    "description": " Build yourself, build your brand, and capitalize on your success to get the quality of life that you deserve. Success is relative, but there are things that the top developers, innovators, managers and leaders do that make them successful. It's not what you think it is, like 'Oh, they just work really hard all the time.' or 'Oh, they are just so much smarter.' or 'Oh, they are just charismatic' or 'Oh, they are just really good negotiators'. It isn't even all about the title(s).In this talk, we are going to go through self analysis and prep, then how to establish your personal brand based off of that analysis and finally how best to capitalize on that personal brand with the help of appropriate professionals and information."
